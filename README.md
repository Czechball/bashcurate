# bashcurate

**This script is now obsolete becaue of the [new Flashpoint curation format](https://bluemaxima.org/flashpoint/datahub/Curation_Format)**

Bash script for easier curating for Flashpoint Flash games

You can install it by running `sudo ./install.sh` (that will copy it to /usr/sbin/ as `curate`, so you can just run `curate [SWF URL]`)
